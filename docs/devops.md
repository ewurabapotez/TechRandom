#### DEVOPS

> Bringing together (2) traditionally contentious groups w/in an IT org

 * App dev measured by:
  > no. of changes, features, defects fixed that are able to be pushed to prod

 * IT OPs & success measured by:
  > system stability, availability, etc.

2. Devops transformation and client transformation strategy benefits
> Idea/Experiment > Code > Build > Deploy > Manage > Learn
> _unit test cases, pkg into executables > runtime env > what happens after > continuous improvement_

 * Velocity: How quickly products can pipe through
 * Quality of what's delivered

3. Use Cases
* optimizing the core systems (legacy of org)
* unlocking legacy (addr culture, integrating multi-disciplinary teams)
* unleashing the digital (cloud native apps, kubernets etc)

What is the take away?
> Devops is about People Process & Tools for the benefit of business agility
